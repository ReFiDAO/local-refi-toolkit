# üìä **The 3-Step Impact Tracking Setup**

## **Step 1: Define What You're Tracking (30 minutes)**

### **üéØ Choose Your Focus Areas**
Select 2-3 specific areas where your community is already active:

**Environmental Impact:**
- [ ] **Trees/Plants**: Number planted, survival rate, area covered
- [ ] **Waste Management**: Amount collected, diverted from landfill, recycled
- [ ] **Water**: Quality improved, amount conserved, pollution prevented
- [ ] **Energy**: Renewable energy generated, energy saved, emissions reduced
- [ ] **Biodiversity**: Species protected, habitat restored, wildlife supported

**Social Impact:**
- [ ] **Education**: People trained, workshops held, skills developed
- [ ] **Community Building**: Events organized, people connected, collaborations formed
- [ ] **Economic**: Local spending increased, jobs created, income generated
- [ ] **Health**: Health improvements, access to services, wellbeing measures
- [ ] **Governance**: Democratic participation, decision-making inclusion, transparency

### **üìù Create Simple Indicators**
For each focus area, write 1-2 simple indicators:

**Example - Community Garden:**
- **Environmental**: "Number of pounds of food grown per month"
- **Social**: "Number of families participating in garden activities"
- **Economic**: "Dollar value of food produced for community"

**Your Indicators:**

**Focus Area 1: ________________**
- Indicator 1: ________________________________
- Indicator 2: ________________________________

**Focus Area 2: ________________**
- Indicator 1: ________________________________
- Indicator 2: ________________________________

**Focus Area 3: ________________**
- Indicator 1: ________________________________
- Indicator 2: ________________________________

## **Step 2: Set Up Data Collection (45 minutes)**

Pick the simplest tool that works for your community:

**Option A: Smartphone Photos + Notes**
- Take photos with date stamps
- Write short notes about what you're documenting
- Store in dedicated phone folder or cloud storage
- **Best for**: Visual impacts, simple counting, informal tracking

**Option B: Simple Spreadsheet**
- Use Google Sheets, Excel, or similar
- Create columns for: Date, Activity, Measurement, Notes, Photos
- Share with team members for collaborative tracking
- **Best for**: Regular measurements, team tracking, basic analysis

**Option C: Free Apps**
- **KoBo Collect**: Free app for community data collection
- **Google Forms**: Simple surveys you can fill out regularly
- **WhatsApp Groups**: Photo sharing with descriptions

### **üóìÔ∏è Create Collection Schedule**
Decide how often you'll collect data:

- [ ] **Daily**: For ongoing activities (waste collection, energy production)
- [ ] **Weekly**: For regular programs (workshops, meetings, garden maintenance)
- [ ] **Monthly**: For broader impacts (community participation, economic effects)
- [ ] **Project-based**: For specific initiatives (tree planting events, cleanups)

### **üë• Assign Responsibilities**
Identify who will collect data:

- **Lead Tracker**: ________________ (overall coordination)
- **Activity Trackers**: 
  - Focus Area 1: ________________
  - Focus Area 2: ________________

## **Step 3: Start Collecting Data (30 minutes)**

### **üèÅ Collect Your First Data**
Document what's happening right now:

**Current Snapshot:**
- **Date**: ________________
- **Activity**: What regenerative work is currently happening?
- **Measurements**: Use your indicators to measure current status
- **Photos**: Take 2-3 photos showing current state
- **Notes**: Write 2-3 sentences about what you're seeing

### **üìã Set Up Regular Data Collection**
Schedule your next data collection sessions:

- **Next collection date**: ________________
- **What will you measure**: ________________
- **Who will do it**: ________________
- **Reminder method**: Calendar, phone alarm, team message

# üõ† **Simple Tools & Templates**

## **Smartphone Photo Tracking Template**
Create a consistent photo naming system:
- **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD_ActivityType_Location`
- **Example**: `2025-01-15_TreePlanting_CommunityPark`
- **Include**: Date taken, brief description in photo caption

## **Basic Spreadsheet Template**

| Date | Activity | Indicator | Measurement | Photos | Notes | Tracker |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|---------|
| 2025-01-15 | Tree Planting | Trees planted | 25 | üì∏ | Good weather, high participation | Maria |
| 2025-01-15 | Workshop | People trained | 12 | üì∏ | Composting basics | John |

## **Simple Story Template**
For sharing impact stories:

**Date**: ________________  
**Activity**: ________________  
**Impact**: ________________  
**Story**: "Today we [activity] and achieved [measurement]. This means [why it matters]. Next we plan to [future plans]."  
**Photo**: [Include one good photo]

# ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Challenges & Quick Fixes**

## **Challenge 1: "We keep forgetting to track"**
**Quick Fixes:**
- Set phone reminders for data collection times
- Link tracking to existing activities (always track after meetings)
- Make one person responsible for reminding others
- Start with less frequent tracking (weekly instead of daily)

## **Challenge 2: "Our measurements don't make sense"**
**Quick Fixes:**
- Simplify indicators to basic counting (number of people, pounds collected, etc.)
- Focus on just one indicator per activity until you get the habit
- Ask: "What's the simplest way to show this is working?"
- Look at what other similar groups are measuring

## **Challenge 3: "We don't have time for this"**
**Quick Fixes:**
- Reduce to 5 minutes per tracking session
- Track only your most important indicator
- Use photos with captions instead of detailed notes
- Make tracking part of activities you're already doing

## **Challenge 4: "The data isn't useful"**
**Quick Fixes:**
- Ask: "What decisions could this data help us make?"
- Focus on measurements that show change over time
- Include stories and photos, not just numbers
- Share data with community to see what they find interesting

## **Challenge 5: "It's too complicated"**
**Quick Fixes:**
- Use only phone photos with voice notes
- Pick just one thing to track for now
- Find the simplest possible measurement
- Ask for help from someone comfortable with technology
