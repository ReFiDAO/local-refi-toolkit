# üëã **Introduction**

### **Local Node Name & Location**
**ReFi Lagos** - Lagos, Nigeria (West Africa's largest urban center with 200+ million people)

### **Mission Statement**
ReFi Lagos is dedicated to leveraging Web3 and regenerative finance principles to address Nigeria's plastic waste crisis while creating economic opportunities for local communities. Their mission focuses on transforming waste from an environmental burden into a regenerative economic resource through blockchain-verified collection and recycling systems.

# üìã **Project Case Study Description**

### **Overview**
Nigeria faces a severe plastic waste crisis, ranking ninth globally in plastic pollution contribution with over 2.5 million tons generated annually. Only 12% of this waste is properly recycled, with the remaining 88% ending up in waterways, landfills, or being illegally dumped. ReFi Lagos addresses this challenge through Web3-enabled solutions that create economic incentives for proper waste collection and recycling.

### **Innovation Highlight**
The project's innovation lies in combining blockchain transparency with community-driven waste collection systems. By using platforms like Plastiks for plastic credit verification and Wasset for tokenized rewards, ReFi Lagos creates verifiable, transparent supply chains for waste collection while providing direct economic benefits to participants.
