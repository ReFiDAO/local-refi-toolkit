# üëã **Introduction**

### **Local Node Name & Location**
**ReFi Sicilia** - Sicily, Italy (Largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, key biodiversity hotspot)

### **Mission Statement**
ReFi Sicilia is dedicated to restoring and protecting Sicily's native Mediterranean forest ecosystems through community-driven reforestation initiatives that leverage regenerative finance for sustainable funding and transparent impact measurement. Their mission centers on demonstrating how bioregional restoration can create ecological, social, and economic benefits while contributing to global climate mitigation efforts.

# üìã **Project Case Study Description**

### **Overview**
Sicily represents a critical ecosystem in the Mediterranean region, with unique biodiversity and significant potential for carbon sequestration through forest restoration. The island has experienced significant deforestation over centuries, creating opportunities for restoration that can provide multiple benefits: carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, soil protection, and community economic development. ReFi Sicilia addresses these opportunities through systematic reforestation efforts that integrate traditional Mediterranean forestry knowledge with modern impact measurement and regenerative finance mechanisms.

### **Innovation Highlight**
The project's key innovation is the integration of community-driven reforestation with Web3-enabled tracking and funding systems that create transparent, verifiable records of forest restoration impact. This approach ensures that reforestation efforts are both ecologically sound and economically sustainable, creating long-term incentives for continued ecosystem restoration.
