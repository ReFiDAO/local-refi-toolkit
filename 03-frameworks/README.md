# ReFi Coordination Frameworks

**Organizational and governance approaches for regenerative finance initiatives**

Welcome to the Local ReFi Toolkit frameworks collection! These comprehensive frameworks provide theoretical foundations, organizational structures, and coordination approaches for building effective regenerative finance initiatives. Unlike our implementation-focused playbooks, frameworks focus on organizational design, governance structures, and coordination methodologies that can be adapted across diverse contexts and scales.
