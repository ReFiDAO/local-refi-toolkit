### Step 2: Content Inventory & Migration
**Current Assets to Inventory:**
- [ ] All ReFi-related notes from `241001 Q4'24/241001 ReFi DAO/`

**Action:** Create inventory spreadsheet with:
- Document name
- Current location
- Content type (playbook/case study/framework/research)
- Target location in new structure
- Migration priority (high/medium/low)

### Step 3: Design Knowledge Taxonomy
**Create classification system:**

**By Implementation Stage:**
- Discovery (learning about ReFi)
- Planning (designing local implementation)
- Launch (getting started)
- Scale (growing impact)
- Sustainability (long-term success)

**By Protocol/Tool:**
- Celo/Plastiks
- Toucan/Carbon Credits
- Regen Network
- Impact DAOs
- Local Currencies
- Regenerative Agriculture Finance

**By Community Context:**
- Urban communities
- Rural/agricultural
- Coastal/marine
- Indigenous communities
- Academic institutions
- Municipal governments
