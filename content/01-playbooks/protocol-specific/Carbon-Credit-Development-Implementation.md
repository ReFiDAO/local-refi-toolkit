# üìö **Background & Context**

## **The Carbon Credit Landscape**

Carbon credits represent a fundamental tool for correcting economic systems that historically treat environmental destruction as "free." Each credit typically represents one metric tonne of CO2 equivalent that has been:
- **Avoided/Reduced**: Prevented from entering the atmosphere
- **Removed/Sequestered**: Withdrawn from the atmosphere and stored

### **Market Overview**
- **Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM)**: $1B+ market growing rapidly toward projected $10B+ by 2030
- **Verra VCS Credits**: Account for 69-85% of VCM trading volume
- **Price Range**: $3-150+ per tonne depending on methodology, vintage, and co-benefits
- **Growth Drivers**: Corporate net-zero commitments, regulatory developments, public climate awareness

## **Carbon Credit Categories**

### **1. Avoidance/Reduction Projects**
- **Forest Conservation (REDD+)**: Preventing deforestation and forest degradation
- **Renewable Energy**: Displacing fossil fuel energy generation  
- **Energy Efficiency**: Reducing energy consumption in buildings, industry
- **Methane Capture**: Capturing methane from landfills, agriculture, oil/gas operations
- **Transportation**: Efficient vehicles, modal shifts, urban planning

### **2. Removal/Sequestration Projects**
- **Reforestation/Afforestation**: Planting trees to sequester atmospheric carbon
- **Regenerative Agriculture**: Soil carbon sequestration through improved farming practices
- **Blue Carbon**: Coastal ecosystem restoration (mangroves, seagrass, wetlands)
- **Direct Air Capture**: Technological carbon removal and storage
- **Biochar**: Converting biomass to stable carbon and soil amendments

## **Key Challenges in Carbon Credit Development**

### **1. Additionality Requirements**
Projects must prove they wouldn't have happened without carbon credit revenue - the most challenging aspect of carbon credit development.

### **2. Baseline and Monitoring**
Establishing credible baselines and implementing rigorous monitoring systems requires significant technical expertise and ongoing resources.

### **3. Permanence Concerns**
Ensuring long-term durability of carbon impacts, especially for nature-based solutions vulnerable to natural disasters or policy changes.

### **4. Market Access and Liquidity**
Navigating complex buyer markets, pricing volatility, and transaction costs that can be prohibitive for smaller projects.
