# üìö **Background & Context**

## **The Challenge Forest Conservation Faces**

Scaling forest conservation faces critical challenges acknowledged by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC):

### **1. Standardization Gap**
- No common consensus on forest MRV implementation
- Existing certification schemes are costly and lack transparency
- Manual paper-based records are prone to loss and inaccuracy

### **2. Data Accuracy Issues**
- Ground-level data collection is often incomplete
- Satellite imagery lacks ground-level precision
- Poor coordination across geographies and projects

### **3. Funding Accessibility**
- Collaborative funding remains difficult due to MRV issues
- Only well-funded projects can afford certified verification
- Marginalized communities cannot demonstrate project value

### **4. Market Fragmentation**
- Carbon markets remain fragmented and illiquid
- Problems with double spending and price volatility
- Lack of standardization prevents market efficiency

## **The Web3 Solution Opportunity**

Blockchain-based forest MRV provides:
- **Decentralized Access**: Global inclusion without traditional barriers
- **Standardization**: Consistent protocols and state consensus
- **Transparency**: Trustless security and verification
- **Innovation Foundation**: Platform for future forest management tools
