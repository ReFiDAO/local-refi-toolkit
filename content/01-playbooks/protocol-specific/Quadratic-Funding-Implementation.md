# üìö **Background & Context**

## **The Challenge Traditional Funding Faces**

Traditional funding mechanisms for public goods and regenerative projects face critical limitations:

### **1. Wealth Concentration**
- Large donors dominate funding decisions
- Small contributors have minimal impact on allocation
- Projects that appeal to wealthy donors get disproportionate funding
- Community preferences may be ignored in favor of major donor interests

### **2. Coordination Failures**
- Difficulty coordinating funding across multiple donors
- Risk of double-funding or funding gaps
- Limited transparency in allocation decisions
- Lack of community input in priority setting

### **3. Misaligned Incentives**
- Projects optimized for appealing to funders rather than community needs
- Limited incentive for small-scale community contributions
- Difficulty measuring genuine community support and impact

## **The Quadratic Funding Solution**

Quadratic funding addresses these challenges by:
- **Democratizing Impact**: Small donations receive proportionally higher matching
- **Measuring Consensus**: Number of contributors matters more than contribution size
- **Amplifying Community Voice**: Genuine grassroots support gets amplified
- **Creating Positive Sum Games**: Encouraging broad participation over wealth concentration

### **How Quadratic Funding Works**
The quadratic funding formula ensures that projects with broad community support receive the largest share of matching funds:

**Match Amount ‚àù (‚àödonation‚ÇÅ + ‚àödonation‚ÇÇ + ... + ‚àödonation‚Çô)¬≤**

This means:
- Many small donations > Few large donations for matching funds
- $1 donation from 100 people receives more matching than $100 from 1 person
- Projects must build genuine community support to maximize funding
