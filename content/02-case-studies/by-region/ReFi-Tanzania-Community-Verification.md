# üëã **Introduction**

### **Local Node Name & Location**
**ReFi Tanzania** - Tanzania, East Africa (Rapidly urbanizing nation with significant waste management challenges)

### **Mission Statement**
ReFi Tanzania is dedicated to empowering local communities to address urban waste challenges through innovative verification systems that ensure transparency, accountability, and community ownership of environmental stewardship efforts. Their mission focuses on building community capacity for environmental action while creating verifiable impact data that can attract regenerative finance funding.

# üìã **Project Case Study Description**

### **Overview**
Tanzania's rapid urbanization has created significant waste management challenges, particularly in major cities like Dar es Salaam and Arusha. Traditional waste management systems often lack the capacity to handle growing urban populations, leading to environmental degradation and public health concerns. ReFi Tanzania addresses these challenges by developing community-driven verification systems that enable local groups to document, verify, and receive recognition for their waste cleanup efforts.

### **Innovation Highlight**
The project's key innovation is the development of community-controlled verification systems that combine local knowledge and organizing with blockchain-based impact tracking. This approach ensures that communities maintain ownership and control over their environmental stewardship efforts while providing transparent, verifiable data that can attract funding and support from regenerative finance networks.
