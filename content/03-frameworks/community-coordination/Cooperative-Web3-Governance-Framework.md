# üåü **Framework Overview**

This framework provides a comprehensive approach to implementing hybrid governance systems that combine traditional cooperative principles with modern Web3 governance tools. Based on the pioneering work of ReFi Barcelona and other cooperative Web3 organizations, this framework enables communities to maintain democratic, member-controlled governance while leveraging blockchain technology for transparency, global participation, and innovative economic models.

The framework addresses the challenge of scaling democratic participation and maintaining cooperative values in the digital age while accessing the benefits of decentralized technologies and global coordination.
