## Executive Summary

The Local ReFi Toolkit represents a transformative initiative to create the definitive knowledge infrastructure for regenerative finance implementation worldwide. This master plan synthesizes four strategic pillars—**Technical Infrastructure**, **Community Coordination**, **Integration & Interoperability**, and **Resource Mapping**—into a unified implementation strategy that bridges Web3 innovation with grassroots regenerative movements.

**Vision**: Transform scattered ReFi knowledge into an intelligent, interconnected ecosystem that enables any community to implement regenerative finance solutions appropriate to their context and needs.

**Strategic Approach**: Rather than building competing platforms, we recommend **convergence with Ethereum Localism** to create shared infrastructure that amplifies both movements while reducing costs and fragmentation.
